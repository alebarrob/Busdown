# Busdown

Busdown is an application that sends your current location to an email list. Originally created at the request of my manager while working at Cognizant, although it was never put into production.

The initial idea was that the application would report the location of employees when the company bus, managed by BusUp, did not arrive on time at its stop. Managers would then know that employees were at the stop when the bus was late. For this reason, BusUp's company email is included in the application's email list by default. 

Although this application has not been used in production, I decided to include the code in this repository to serve as an example of using Constraint Layout to create views and permissions to access the location of users.
